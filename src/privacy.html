      <p class="doc__p">By using this site, you agree to the Privacy Policy of BFG Advisors Ltd. If you do not agree to
        the Policy, please do not use this site.</p>
      <p class="doc__p">By registering as a user of the services provided by BFG Advisors Ltd and using the BFG Advisors
        Ltd website generally, you are indicating that you have read this Privacy Policy and understand that your
        personal
        information may be used as described below.</p>
      <p class="doc__p">BFG Advisors Ltd which operates the Internet site located at www.bfg-advisors.com, recognises
        the
        importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected about visitors to our
        sites.
        As a general policy, no personally identifiable information, such as your name, address or email address, is
        automatically collected from visitors to our sites. Personally identifiable information about visitors to our
        sites is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted via registration, contact forms, or Live Chat.
        We
        may collect certain non-personal information to optimize our Web pages for your computer (i.e. the identity of
        your Internet browser, the type of operating system you use, your IP address and the domain name of your
        Internet
        service provider). We may use such non-personal information for internal purposes, including but not limited to,
        improving the content of our sites.</p>
      <p class="doc__p">In those instances when we do collect personally identifiable information, the following
        policies
        apply:</p>
      <p class="doc__p">BFG Advisors Ltd will notify you when we are collecting personally identifiable information
        about
        you and how we intend to use it. For example, we may need to collect such information to provide you with
        information on a requested product.</p>
      <p class="doc__p">BFG Advisors Ltd may engage in activity with business partners with whom personal information is
        jointly collected or shared. We will try to make it clear at the time of collection who is asking for and/or
        sharing your information. In situations where your information will be shared, it is recommended that you also
        review the privacy policy of our business partner.</p>
      <h3 class="h3 doc__h3">Use and Security</h3>
      <p class="doc__p">Personally identifiable information that visitors submit to our sites is used only for the
        purpose
        for which it is submitted unless we disclose other uses in this Privacy Policy or at the time of collection. BFG
        Advisors Ltd cannot be held responsible for the privacy policies or practices of our business partners.</p>
      <p class="doc__p">Personal information may be disclosed in special situations where BFG Advisors Ltd has reason to
        believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against anyone damaging, injuring,
        or interfering (intentionally or unintentionally) with BFG Advisors Ltd’s rights, property, users, or anyone
        else
        who could be harmed by such activities. Also, BFG Advisors Ltd may reveal information when we believe in good
        faith that the law requires it.</p>
      <p class="doc__p">BFG Advisors Ltd maintains appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy
        of
        personally identifiable information submitted to our sites, and periodically reviews and updates its security
        measures in light of current technologies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be
        guaranteed
        to be totally secure. Although BFG Advisors Ltd strives to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure

        is
        done so at your own risk. Once we do receive your transmission, however, we make our best effort to ensure its
        security on our systems.</p>
